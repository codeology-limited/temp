/**
*  MY RATIONALE:
 *
 * I have taken the position of "less is more", simplicity and keeping close to the context of the brief.
 * The brief espouses a simple application, so the codebase has been kept fairly straight forward
 * with only 1 service and 1 module/component.
 *
 * Simply put I didn't want to over bake it.
 *
 * I have added some basic styling but kept to overall look and feel.
 *
 * I have kept the data management on the front end simple by just requesting the whole list at each update.
 * There was the possibility of managing the list state locally as it is a simple application and while the chance of the
 * list becoming stale with this sort incremental management strategy (IE: adding the item to the list as a result of
 * the input or the individual response from the back end) is minimal it is a simple application, so I refresh the list
 * wholesale each time ensuring it won't get out of sync.
 *
 * There is an argument to say that when the list becomes larger my solution becomes less viable and that is true but
 * for that to happen we would need to consider a database and much larger datasets ( likely multiuser ) and now we are
 * talking fetching, sorting and pagination done by the database so more complex code.  However, my current solution would
 * still actually work under this circumstance and managing incremental list state locally would then be a team preference
 * and would suggest a wider play is in progress, but for this exercise I took the stance that there is not a wider
 * play in progress.  I also took this stance, in regard to any componentization.  To my mind 1 is sufficient for this
 * task.
 *
 * The node backend, while tempting to refactor and tidy to my liking, I found to be readable and understandable. So I
 * made minimal consequential changes to the backend.
 *
 * The one change I did make was to the post and put routes.  I check for the existence of the ID member being passed in.
 * The reason for this is that the create and update code was structured in a way that you could create your own ids and
 * overwrite the assigned id.  The other option is more checking in the create and update methods, but I like the
 * simplicity of that code and validating the request as a habit is more prudent in my opinion.
 *
 * TESTS:
 *
 *      In my opinion testing is a progressive discipline, so testing lacking now can be made up for in the future when
 *      required.
 *
 *      I have not specifically unit tested anything, per se, as there is really not that much logic to test.
 *      Of course this is a subjective opinion of mine, because a case could always be made but my position here is
 *      that these test would add more complexity to the system than the value they would bring.  The exception here
 *      is the error handlers. If they were to get more complex, then they would benefit from a unit test.
 *
 *      I have UI tested the primary functionality.  The post to the backend is mocked, and there already exist tests
 *      of the API around posting.  I have also added two tests to the create in the back end.
 *
